The grey colour between the top of the coloured curve and '1' on the Y-axis is composed of variants that aren't currently tracked on CoVariants.
Sequence counts are binned into 2-week intervals.



It is worth interpreting with caution:
- Not all samples are representative - sometimes some samples are more likely to be sequenced than others (for containing a particular mutation, for example)
- The last data point - this often has incomplete data and may change as more sequences come in
- Frequencies that are very 'jagged' - this often indicates low sequencing numbers and so may not be truly representative of the country
- In many places, sampling may not be equal across the region: samples may only cover one area or certain areas. It's important not to assume frequencies shown are necessarily representative.
