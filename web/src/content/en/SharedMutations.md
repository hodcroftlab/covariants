Many of variants that have emerged since the end of 2020 share defining amino acid mutations. Some of these are mutations that are of interest to scientists. This table displays the amino acid mutations shared by the variants below (top), and the other defining mutations of these variants (below). You can toggle how the shared mutations are sorted.

You can read more about each of the variants on the pages for <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="20H (Beta, V2)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="21A (Delta)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="21B (Kappa)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="21D (Eta)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="21G (Lambda)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="21H (Mu)" prefix=""/>, and the <Who name="Omicron" /> family.

If you need a reminder of how the nomenclature lines up, you can see a table on our [homepage](/)!
