### <VarOrLinText name={'22B (Omicron)'} />
Also known as <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" invert={true}/> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="clusters/OmicronHeader.mdx" />

<VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)"/> likely arose in early 2022, possibly in South Africa. Early sequences are predominantly from South Africa, though it was detected more widely, particularly in Europe, by April 2022.

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

<MdxContent filepath="clusters/22A22B_Spike.mdx" />

On top of the many mutations outside of the Spike that <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> shares with <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> additionally has a mutation at <AaMut mut={"M:D3N"}/> and a reversion (compared to <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>) at <AaMut mut={"ORF6:D61L"}/>.

<AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/> has arisen multiple times within <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. In South Africa, where this variant is suspected to have originated, it is most present as wild type (L), while outside of South Africa, the <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/> mutation is more common. Thus, sub-clades of <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may or may not have <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/>, depending on whether they descend from part of <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying this mutation. Notably, <VarOrLin name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, thought to have arisen in South Africa, do <i>not</i> have this mutation, whereas <VarOrLin name="22C (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, thought to have originated in North America, has it.
