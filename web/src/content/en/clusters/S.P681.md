<AaMut mut={"S:P681H"}/> is present in <VarOrLin name="20I (Alpha, V1)"/>, <VarOrLin name="21B (Kappa)"/>, and <VarOrLin name="21A (Delta)"/> as well as some other circulating variants.

- <AaMut mut={"S:P681H"}/> may reduce class 3 antibody recognition (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.06.20248960v1">Haynes et al., medRxiv</LinkExternal>)
- This mutation is near the furin cleavage site, which may be important for immune recognition ([Johnson et al., bioRxiv](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7457603/))
