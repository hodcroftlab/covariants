### 23A (Omicron)
Also known as <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" invert={true} /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="OmicronHeader.md'" />

<VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)"/> likely arose at the end of 2022, possibly in North America. The first sequences date to late October 2022 and come from the north-east of the USA, but the variant has spread significantly since then.
<br/><br/>

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

<VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is a recombinant variant as it descends from <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, which is a recombination of lineage <Lin name="BJ.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.10.1.1"/>) (part of <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>) and <Lin name="BM.1.1.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.75.3.1.1.1"/>) (part of <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>). 
<br/>
<br/>

Thus, <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same mutations as <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, with a few additional mutations, including <AaMut mut={"S:G252V"}/> and <AaMut mut={"ORF8:G8*"}/>. <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> also has an additional nucleotide mutation at position <NucMut mut="T23018C" />, which results in the <AaMut mut={"S:F486S"}/> in <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> becoming <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/>. This change from <code>S</code> to <code>P</code> has implications for ACE2 binding (see below).
<br/>
<br/>


Additionally, <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has a unique synonymous mutation at <NucMut mut="T17124C" />.
<br/>
<br/>

From the Spike mutations in <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, there is an expectation that immune evasion is likely similar to its parental lineages, <Lin name="XBB.1"/> and <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (<Lin name="XBB"/>), but that transmission may be enhanced by the new <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/> mutation.
- Neutralizing titers in vaccinated (CoronaVac) patients with BF.7 breakthrough infection were similar against <Lin name="XBB.1"/> and <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, but ACE2 binding was much stronger in <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, suggesting a mechanism for a growth advantage of <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> over <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Lin name="XBB.1"/>. [Yue et al., Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00010-5/fulltext)
- Another study in vaccinated/infected individuals found only little difference in neutralizing titers and fusogenicity between <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, <Lin name="XBB.1"/>, and <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> [Qu et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.16.524244v1.full)
- Neutralizing antibody titers were also similar between <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Lin name="XBB.1"/> in a study looking at bivalently-boosted mRNA vaccine recipients [Lasrado et al., bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.22.525079v1.full)
