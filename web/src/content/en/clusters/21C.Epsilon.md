_Note that as of 2 Sept 2021, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is little ongoing circulation. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

<Var name={'21C (Epsilon)'}/> was first identified in California and appears to have increased in frequency (<LinkExternal href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776543">Zhang et al., JAMA</LinkExternal>). <br/>

- Neutralizing titers in plasma from vaccinated individuals were reduced 3-6 fold against <Var name={'21C (Epsilon)'}/> compared to wild-type, and neutralization of mAbs targetting N-terminal domain was completely lost ([McCallum et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925v1))
- Viral shedding was increased 2-fold for <Var name={'21C (Epsilon)'}/> compared to wild-type in pseudoviruses, and neutralization titers showed a 4-6.7 fold and 2-fold decrease in convalescent plasma and plasma from vaccinated individuals, respectively (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21252647v1">Deng et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)

### S:L452R
- In a study co-incubating pseudotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and monocolonal antibodies, viruses with <AaMut mut={'S:L452R'}/> mutations escaped neutralization by monoclonal antibodies SARS2-01, SARS-02, and SARS2-32 and some convalescent sera. Additionally, this study found modest increase in infectivity as measured by soluble mACE2 ([Liu et al., Cell Host & Microbe](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312821000445))
- May increase binding affinity with ACE2 receptor ([Chen et al., JMB](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620304563?via%3Dihub))
- Experimentally, Spike gene expression increased 0.32 fold with this mutation ([Starr et al., Cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.012)).
- Ranked effective mutant against this position in the RBD for highly neutralizing COV2-2096 ([Greaney et al., Cell Host & Microbe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.11.007)).
- Escape mutation against monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555, the antibody that forms the basis for Eli Lilly's bamlanivimab treatment for COVID-19 ([Starr et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431683v1)).
- Resistent to some neutralizing antibodies: mAbs X593 and P2B-2F6 ([Li et al., Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420308771)).
- <AaMut mut={'S:L452R'}/> reduced or abolished neutralizing activity of 14 of 35 RBD monoclonal antibodies (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925v1">McCallum et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
