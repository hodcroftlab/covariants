### 21J (Delta)
Also known as <Who name="Delta" />

_Note that as of 2 Mar 2023, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is little ongoing circulation. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

<Var name={'21J (Delta)'}/> is part of the "Variant of Concern" <Who name="Delta" />. It is a sub-clade of this varaint, which has grown extensively worldwide. <Var name={'21J (Delta)'} prefix=""/> has grown particularly in Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania.
<br /><br />

<Var name={'21J (Delta)'} prefix=""/> has all the mutations of <Var name="21A (Delta)" prefix=""/>. In addition, it has an extra mutation in <code>N</code> at position <AaMut mut={'N:G215C'}/>. It also has additional amino-acid mutations in <code>ORF1a</code>, <code>ORF1b</code>, and <code>ORF7b</code>: <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:A1306S'}/>, <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:V2930L'}/>, <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:T3255I'}/>, <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:T3646A'}/>, <AaMut mut={'ORF1b:A1918V'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'ORF7b:T40I'}/>. The mutation <AaMut mut={'S:G142D'}/> is likely present in all <Who name="Delta" /> sequences, but can be shown as 'wild type' due to sequencing problems from the ARTIC V3 schema ([Sanderson and Barrett, Wellcome Open](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-305/v1)); here, it is shown as part of the defining list of mutations. 

Finally, <Var name={'21J (Delta)'} prefix=""/> has synonymous nucleotide mutations at positions <NucMut mut="C8986T" /> and <NucMut mut="A11332G" />.
