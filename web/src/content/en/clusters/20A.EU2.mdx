_Note that as of 2 Sept 2021, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is little ongoing circulation. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

_Note this cluster is only the European appearance of <AaMut mut="S:S477N" />. The same mutation also appeared in [Nextstrain Clade 20F](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?label=clade:20F) in an outbreak in Jun-Oct 2020._

Another variant with <AaMut mut={'S:S477N'}/> arose independently in Australia (Nextstrain Clade 20F) and was responsible for much of the Jun-Oct 2020 outbreak ([Nextstrain build](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/oceania/2020-11-16?c=gt-S_477)).
Over the northern-hemisphere summer of 2020, <VarOrLin name="20A.EU2"/> became the second most dominant variant in Western Europe, after <VarOrLin name="20E (EU1)"/>. Though early sequences come from France, more detailed analysis of the origins is needed.
