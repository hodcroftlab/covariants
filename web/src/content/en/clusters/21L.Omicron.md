### 21L (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.2" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="OmicronHeader.md'" />

<Var name="21L (Omicron)" /> and <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> share 38 nucleotide and amino-acid mutations, but <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional 27, while <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional 20. 

Looking just at Spike, both share 21 amino-acid mutations, with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying an additional 12 unique amino-acid mutations and <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying an additional 6 (plus a deletion/mutation - see below). Notably, <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> lacks the deletion at <AaMut mut={'S:H69-'}/> and <AaMut mut={'S:V70-'}/> (see <Mut name="S:H69-"/>)) which cases the "S-gene drop out" or SGTF that has been used to track <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in TaqPath PCR tests. 

The 6 additional Spike mutations in <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> are: <AaMut mut={'S:T19I'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:V213G'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:S371F'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:T376A'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:D405N'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:R408S'}/>. 
On top of this, there is a 9 nucleotide deletion from position 21633-21641 which leads to the deletions and mutation <AaMut mut={'S:L24-'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:P25-'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:P26-'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:A27S'}/> (as with other deletion/mutations, this is sometimes alternatively reported as <AaMut mut={'S:L24S'}/>, followed by 3 deletions - the resulting protein is identical).

<AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/> has arisen multiple times within <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, but in South Africa, where this variant is suspected to have originated, it is most present as wild type (L). Outside of South Africa, the <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/> mutation is more common. Thus, sub-clades of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may or may not have <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/>, depending on whether they descend from part of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying this mutation. Notably, <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, thought to have arisen in South Africa, do _not_ have this mutation, whereas <Var name="22C (Omicron)"/>, thought to have originated in North America, has it.
