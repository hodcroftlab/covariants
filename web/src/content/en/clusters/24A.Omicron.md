### <VarOrLinText name={'24A (Omicron)'} />
Also known as <VarOrLin name="24A (Omicron)" invert={true}/> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="clusters/OmicronHeader.md" />

<VarOrLin name="24A (Omicron)"/> likely emerged in late-2023, possibly in Europe, but has grown rapidly worldwide since then. It came to dominate globally in early 2024.

<VarOrLin name="24A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is a direct descendant of <VarOrLin name="23I (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, and shares all the same mutations, insertions, and deletions, with a handful of additional mutations.
<br/>
<br/>

Most notably, <VarOrLin name="24A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional Spike mutation at <AaMut mut={"S:L455S"}/>, as well as amino-acid mutations at <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:K1973R"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:R3821K"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"ORF7b:F19L"}/>.
<br/>

In addition, there are synonymous mutations at <NucMut mut="T3565C" />, <NucMut mut="C12815T" />, and <NucMut mut="C18894T" />.
