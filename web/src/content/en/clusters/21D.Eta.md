Also known as <Lin name="B.1.525" /> and <Who name="Eta" />

_Note that as of 24 Feb 2022, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there have been no new sequences seen in this cluster for many months. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

<Var name="21D (Eta)"/> appears to have arisen in late 2020, and as of March 2021 has been detected in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

This variant carries some mutations that are also seen in the variants of concern. <AaMut mut={"S:E484K"}/> (see <Mut name="S:E484"/>), is shared with <Var name="20H (Beta, V2)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)" prefix=""/>. <Mut name="S:H69-"/>, <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"}/>, and <Mut name="S:Y144-"/> are shared with <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/>.

Further, this variant has the same 3 amino acid deletion in `ORF1a` at positions 3675-3677 that is seen in three variants of concern, as well as <Var name="21F (Iota)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="21G (Lambda)" prefix=""/> (see <Mut name="ORF1a:S3675"/>).

In addition, mutation <AaMut mut={"S:Q677H"}/> has appeared multiple times (see <Var name="S:Q677"/>). There are also further mutations in Spike: <AaMut mut={"S:Q52R"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:A67V"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"Q:F888L"}/>.
