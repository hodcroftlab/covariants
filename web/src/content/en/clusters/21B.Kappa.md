### 21B (Kappa)
Also known as <Lin name="B.1.617.1" /> and <Who name="Kappa" />

_Note that as of 24 Feb 2022, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there have been no new sequences seen in this cluster for many months. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

<Var name={'21B (Kappa)'}/> was first detected in India and grew rapidly, alongside its sister-clade, <Var name={'21A (Delta)'}/>. However, it never achieved the same success.
<br/>
<br/>
<Var name={'21B (Kappa)'} prefix=""/> has Spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:L452R'}/> (see <Var name={'21C (Epsilon)'}/> page for more details) and <Mut name="S:P681"/>, both of which impact antibody binding.<br />

<Var name={'21B (Kappa)'} prefix=""/> has additional spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:E154K'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:Q1071H'}/>.
In particular, mutations at position <Mut name="S:E484"/> have been linked to reduction in antibody binding, reinfection, and decrease in convalescent and vaccine serum neutralization.
However, many of these studies focused on <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/>, wereas the mutation in <Var name={'21B (Kappa)'}/> is <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>.

<br/>
- Spike with <AaMut mut={'S:L452R'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:P681R'}/> may have reduced cell-entry efficacy, and has modestly reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.08.443253v1">Ferreria et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
