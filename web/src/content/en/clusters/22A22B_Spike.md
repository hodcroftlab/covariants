<Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> have identical Spike proteins, and thus research that studies the Spike exclusively (for example, most antibody studies), often group them together.
<br/>

<Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> share many Spike mutations with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and even more Spike mutations with <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. In fact, the Spike mutations in <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> are identical except for that in <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, <AaMut mut={"S:Q493R"}/> is absent and <AaMut mut={"S:L452R"}/> and <AaMut mut={"S:F486V"}/> are present, along with the <Mut name="S:H69-"/> and <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"}/> deletion, which they share with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>.
<br/><br/>

In a <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> background (which does not have the deletion), the <Mut name="S:H69-"/> and <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"}/> deletion allows <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> to be detected through "S gene drop out" or "S gene target failure (SGTF)" in certain qPCR assays.

- In South Africa, <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> rapidly replaced <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, with estimated growth advantages over <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> estimated at 0.08 and 0.12, respectively (similar to the estimated advantage of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> over <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>). As well as immune evasion (see points below), waning immunity after the initial <WhoBadge name="Omicron" /> may be a factor in the increased transmission advantage ([Tegally et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.01.22274406v1))
- Neutralizing immunity against <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> dropped 7.6- and 7.5-fold, respectively, compared to <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, in unvaccinated individuals who had been infected with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. In vaccinated (Pfizer or J&J) individuals who had been infected with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, titers dropped 3.2- and 2.6-fold, respectively ([Khan et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274477v1))
- Neutralizing titers against <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> were reduced compared to <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in vaccinated (CoronaVac) individuals, with a stronger reduction in vaccinated individuals who had been previously infected with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> ([Cao et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.30.489997v1))
- ACE2 binding affinity was markedly reduced in <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, compared with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, possibly due to the <AaMut mut={"S:F486V"}/> mutation and a reversion at <AaMut mut={"S:R493Q"}/> ([Cao et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.30.489997v1))
- <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> escape many of the same monoclonal antibodies as <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (see paper for full chart) (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.30.489997v1">Cao et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
