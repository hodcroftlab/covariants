### <VarOrLinText name={'21G (Lambda)'} />

Also known as <VarOrLin name="21G (Lambda)" invert={true} /> and <Who name="Lambda" />

_Note that as of 3 May 2022, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is little ongoing circulation. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

<VarOrLin name="21G (Lambda)"/> appears to have arisen in late 2020 in South America. Early sequences are predominantly from Peru and Chile.
It has now also been detected in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.
<br/><br/>

This variant carries the mutation <AaMut mut={"S:L452Q"}/>, which is a mutation position seen in other variants of concern/interest, though as <AaMut mut={"S:L452R"}/>.
(See the [Shared Mutations Table](/shared-mutations) for a full list of shared mutations.)
<VarOrLin name="21G (Lambda)" prefix=""/> also has a characteristic 7 amino acid deletion in the Spike protein (<AaMut mut={"S:R246-"}/> to <AaMut mut={"S:G252-"}/>).

Further, this variant has the same 3 amino acid deletion in `ORF1a` at positions 3675-3677 that is seen in three variants of concern, as well as <VarOrLin name="21D (Eta)" prefix=""/> and <VarOrLin name="21F (Iota)" prefix=""/> (see <Mut name="ORF1a:S3675"/>).

- <VarOrLin name="21G (Lambda)" prefix=""/> was first identified in April 2021, and an initial description and observation of the variant can be found in <LinkExternal href="https://virological.org/t/novel-sublineage-within-b-1-1-1-currently-expanding-in-peru-and-chile-with-a-convergent-deletion-in-the-orf1a-gene-3675-3677-and-a-novel-deletion-in-the-spike-gene-246-252-g75v-t76i-l452q-f490s-t859n/685">Romero et al., Virological</LinkExternal>
- Pseudotyped lentivirus work showed a reduction in neutralization of 3.05-fold for <VarOrLin name="21G (Lambda)" prefix=""/> compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 ([Acevedo et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.21259673v1))
- See the [CoV-Lineages report](https://cov-lineages.org/lineages/lineage_C.37.html) on this variant.
