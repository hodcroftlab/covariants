### 22B (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.5" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="OmicronHeader.md'" />

<Var name="22B (Omicron)"/> likely arose in early 2022, possibly in South Africa. Early sequences are predominantly from South Africa, though it was detected more widely, particularly in Europe, by April 2022.
<br/><br/>

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

<br/>

On top of the many mutations outside of the Spike that <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> shares with <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> additionally has a mutation at <AaMut mut={"M:D3N"}/> and a reversion (compared to <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>) at <AaMut mut={"ORF6:D61L"}/>.

<AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/> has arisen multiple times within <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. In South Africa, where this variant is suspected to have originated, it is most present as wild type (L), while outside of South Africa, the <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/> mutation is more common. Thus, sub-clades of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may or may not have <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3201F"}/>, depending on whether they descend from part of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> carrying this mutation. Notably, <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, thought to have arisen in South Africa, do <i>not</i> have this mutation, whereas <Var name="22C (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, thought to have originated in North America, has it.
