### S:Q677
- <AaMut mut={'S:Q677'}/> mutants were identified as being present in the USA in the 20G ("20C-US") clade (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.11.426287v2">Pater et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
- A study identified at least seven independant lineages of <AaMut mut={'S:Q677'}/> circulating in the USA, all seeming to have originated and spread in the last few months of 2020. This could be a sign of convergent or parallel evolution. ([Hodcroft et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251658v2))
- Though 677 is nearby to, though outside of, the furin binding pocket (polybasic site), important for S1/S2 cleavage. Hypothetically the presence of a proline (the <AaMut mut={'S:Q677P'}/> mutation) could influence cleavage of S1/S2 ([Hodcroft et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251658v2))
