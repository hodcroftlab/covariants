### <VarOrLinText name={'23H (Omicron)'} />
Also known as <VarOrLin name="23H (Omicron)" invert={true}/> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="clusters/OmicronHeader.mdx" />

<VarOrLin name="23H (Omicron)"/> likely arose in May or June 2023, likely in China. The first sequences date to June 2023, and it became dominant in China by September 2023.

<VarOrLin name="23H (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is the largest sub-lineage of its parent <VarOrLin name="23F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (<Lin name="EG.5.1" />) with the <AaMut mut={"S:L455F"} /> mutation, and hence the 'FLip' genotype, as <VarOrLin name="23F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> already possesses <AaMut mut={"S:F456L"} />. This genotype is so-called because of the abbreviations of the amino-acids involved and the fact that the location of the <code>F</code> and <code>L</code> amino-acids is switched. This mutation combination is associated with increased transmissibility and immune escape (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.30.555211v2">Jian et al. bioRXiv</LinkExternal>, <LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.11.557206v1">Qu et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>, <LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.566985v1">Kosugi et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>). While <AaMut mut={"S:L455F"} /> has occurred repeatedly within <VarOrLin name="23F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, <VarOrLin name="23H (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is approximately half of global <VarOrLin name="23F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> sequences with this genotype as of the end of 2023.

<VarOrLin name="23H (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same mutations as <VarOrLin name="23F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, with the addition of <AaMut mut={"S:L455F"} /> (giving the 'FLip' genotype described above), and <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:D54N"} />, and synonymous mutations at <NucMut mut="C6541T" /> and <NucMut mut="C25572T" />.

The 'FLip' genotype has arisen independently in multiple variants in 2023, and likely allowed <VarOrLin name="23H (Omicron)" prefix=""/> to spread well, particularly in Asia, where it is most common as of the end of 2023.
