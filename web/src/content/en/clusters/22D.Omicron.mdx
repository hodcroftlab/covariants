### <VarOrLinText name={'22D (Omicron)'} />
Also known as <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" invert={true} /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="clusters/OmicronHeader.mdx" />

<VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)"/> appears to have arisen in late spring 2022, possibly in India. As of July 2022, the majority of sequences of this lineage have been detected in India, but many have also been detected around the world.

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

<VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> shares many Spike mutations with <VarOrLin name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and even more Spike mutations with <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same Spike mutations as its parent, <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, except for <AaMut mut={"S:G446S"} /> (a reversion to <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>'s parent, 21M) and <AaMut mut={"S:R493Q"} /> (a reversion to wild-type), and the additional mutations: <AaMut mut={"S:K147E"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:W152R"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:F157L"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:I210V"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:G257S"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:G339H"} /> and <AaMut mut={"S:N460K"}/>.

<VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> does not have the <Mut name="S:H69-"/> and <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"} /> deletion found in <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <VarOrLin name="22C (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, and so could in theory be detected through "S gene drop out" in a <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> background. However, care should be taken to ensure such sequences are indeed <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and not another variant with the same deletion.

- As also found in <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <VarOrLin name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, adintrevimab, bamlanivimab, casirivimab, etesevimab and imdevimab were not found to be effective against <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. Ragdanvimab, sotrovimab, and tixagevimab, while not functional against <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <VarOrLin name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, were found to be effective against <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. However, <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> exhibited higher resistance against cilgavimab and bebtelovimab than <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. ([Yamasoba et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.14.500041v1.full))
- <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> was found to be more immune-evasive than <VarOrLin name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in areas with previously high levels of <Who name="Delta" /> infection (which may explain its success in India), and may escape <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>-induced immunity due to the <AaMut mut={"S:N460K"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:G446S"} />, <AaMut mut={"S:G339H"} /> and <AaMut mut={"S:R493Q"} /> mutations. <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may also have higher ACE-2 binding affinity than <VarOrLin name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500332v1">Cao et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
- A study with donated blood from Sweden failed to find greater immune evasion by <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> than <VarOrLin name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> was found to have moderate suceptibility to tixagevimab and cilgavimab. ([Sheward et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.19.500716v1.abstract))


<VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix="" /> has additional amino-acid mutations outside of Spike, compared to <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix="" />: <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:S1221L"} />, <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:P1640S"} />, <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:N4060S"} />, <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:G662S"} />, and <AaMut mut={"E:T11A"} />.
