_Note that as of 11 Oct 2021, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is a significant decline in the number of sequences observed. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

<VarOrLin name="20A/S:126A"/> appears to have arisen in late 2020 in Africa, possibly in Cameroon (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256637v1">Dudas et al, medRxiv</LinkExternal>). It has now also been detected in North America, Asia, and Europe.

This variant carries a number of mutations that are also seen in the variants of concern/interest, such as: <AaMut mut={"S:P26S"}/>, <Mut name="S:H69-"/> and <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"}/>, <Mut name="S:Y144-"/>, a deletion from <AaMut mut={"S:L241-"}/> to <AaMut mut={"S:A243-"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:E484K"}/> (see <Mut name="S:E484"/>), <AaMut mut={"S:P681H"}/> (see <Mut name="S:P681"/>), <AaMut mut={"S:T1027I"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"S:D1118H"}/>.

Additionally, it has <AaMut mut={"S:S477N"}/> (see <Mut name="S:S477"/>), also found in <VarOrLin name="20A.EU2" prefix=""/>. (See the [Shared Mutations Table](/shared-mutations) for a full list of shared mutations.)

Further, <VarOrLin name="20A/S:126A" prefix=""/> has the same 3 amino acid deletion in `ORF1a` at positions 3675-3677 that is seen in three variants of concern, as well as <VarOrLin name="21D (Eta)" prefix=""/>, <VarOrLin name="21F (Iota)" prefix=""/>, and <VarOrLin name="21G (Lambda)" prefix=""/> (see <Mut name="ORF1a:S3675"/>).

- <VarOrLin name="20A/S:126A" prefix=""/> is predicted to escape antibody-mediated immunity due to the mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD) while maintaining good ACE2 binding (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256637v1">Dudas et al, medRxiv</LinkExternal>)
