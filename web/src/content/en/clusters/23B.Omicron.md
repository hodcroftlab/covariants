### <VarOrLinText name={'23B (Omicron)'} />
Also known as <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" invert={true}/> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<MdxContent filepath="clusters/OmicronHeader.md" />

<VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)"/> likely arose at the end of 2022 or start of 2023, likely in Asia. The first sequences date to January 2023 and the variant has spread significantly since then.
<br/><br/>

<VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> descends from the variant <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, which is a recombination of lineage <Lin name="BJ.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.10.1.1"/>) (part of <VarOrLin name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>) and <Lin name="BM.1.1.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.75.3.1.1.1"/>) (part of <VarOrLin name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>).
<br/>
<br/>

Thus, <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same mutations as <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, with a few additional mutations, including <AaMut mut={"S:G252V"}/> and <AaMut mut={"ORF8:G8*"}/> (both also seen in <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, from their common ancestor), as well as <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3829F"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:D1746Y"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF9b:I5T"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"ORF9b:N55S"}/>.
<br/>
Also like <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> but arising independently, <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional nucleotide mutation at position <NucMut mut="T23018C" />, which results in the <AaMut mut={"S:F486S"}/> in <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> becoming <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/>. This change from <code>S</code> to <code>P</code> has implications for ACE2 binding (see the <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> page). Additionally, <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has a unique synonymous mutations at <NucMut mut="T12730A" />, <NucMut mut="A14856G" />, and <NucMut mut="C29386T" />.
<br/>
<br/>

From the Spike mutations in <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, there is an expectation that immune evasion is likely similar to its parental lineages, <Lin name="XBB.1"/> and <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (<Lin name="XBB"/>), but again, as in <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, this may be enhanced by the <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/> mutation, and possibly further enhanced by RBD mutation <AaMut mut={"S:T478R"}/>. The impact of the Spike mutation <AaMut mut={"S:E180V"}/> is less clear.

- Neutralizing titers against sera from mRNA-vaccinated individuals with breakthrough BA.2/BA.5 infection suggest <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> evades immunity, possibly similarly to <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. As with <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (and other <VarOrLin name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> sublineages), it is resistant to all monoclonal antibodies except strovimab. [Yamasoba et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535883v3)
- Binding affinity of <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> to the ACE2 receptor may be lower than <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> but higher than <Lin name="XBB.1" />. <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> was also estimated to have a higher reproductive number than <VarOrLin name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Lin name="XBB.1" />. [Yamasoba et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535883v3)
- Early reports from India have suggested changing demographic and clinical associations with <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> infection, including reports of conjunctivitis. [Vashishtha et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.18.23288715v1)
- The WHO designated <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> as a Variant of Interest (VOI) on 17 April 2023. The Initial Risk Assessment is avilable [here](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/21042023xbb.1.16ra-v2.pdf?sfvrsn=84577350_1) (updated risk assessments may be available from the main WHO website).

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <VarOrLin name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.
