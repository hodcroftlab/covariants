_Note that as of 2 Sept 2021, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is little ongoing circulation. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

### 20A/S:439K

About 2/3 of the sequences in this variant have deletions at Spike amino-acid positions 69 and 70 ([Nextstrain build with S:69- deletion in the variant highlighted](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/S.N439K?c=gt-S_69&label=clade:S.N439K); see <Mut name="S:H69-"/> page)

Clusters defined by <AaMut mut={'S:N439K'}/> have emerged twice independently in Europe. However, the first was exclusive to Scotland in the first wave and went extinct ([Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1))

### S:N439K
This mutation is in the receptor binding domain (RDB), important to ACE2 binding and antibody recognition

- <AaMut mut={'S:N439K'}/> may increase ACE2 binding (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1">Thompson et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal> & <LinkExternal href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283620304563">Chen - et al., JMB</LinkExternal>; see also <LinkExternal href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_DMS/">Bloom Lab ACE2 binding - website</LinkExternal>).
- Confers resistance to one of the two antibodies in the Regeneron cocktail (REGN10987) (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.405472v1.full">Starr et al. bioRxiv</LinkExternal> and <LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1">Thompson et al. bioRxiv</LinkExternal>).
- May confer resistance to antibodies: C135 ([Weisblum et al. eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61312), [Barnes et al. Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2852-1)); and a panel of antibodies ([Thompson et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.355842v1)). 
- Also resistent to neutralizing mAb H00S022
([Li et al. Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420308771)).
- 6.8% of 442 tested post-infection sera showed a greater than two-fold
reduction in binding to N439K RBD as compared to WT. In some individuals, the >two-fold reduction diminished the RBD ED50 response below 30
a threshold previously determined to be a cutoff for specific binding
([Thomson et al. Cell](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)00080-5)).
- Ablates binding by class 3 mAbs such as C135 that do not directly interfere with ACE2 binding, BUT clonal somatic mutations of memory B cells at 6.2 months (evolving humoral immune response) show pronounced increase in binding to the variant ([Gaebler et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.03.367391v2)).
