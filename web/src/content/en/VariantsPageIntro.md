Click one of the colored buttons to look at a particular [Variant](/variants) - to read information, see graphs and the protein structure, and link out to focused Nextstrain builds.

To look at many variants at once, check out the [Per Variant](/per-variant) and [Per Country](/per-country) pages, where you can view a lot of data in the same place, and compare variants and countries!

Variants included on CoVariants include internationally recognised Variants of Concern (VoC) and many Variants of Interest (VoI), as well as other variants which have expanded rapidly, dominated in countries or regions, or feature mutations of interest.

Mutations included on CoVariants are mutations associated with VoCs or other variants, which have an association with observed or hypothetical changes in viral transmission, immune escape, or clinical outcome.

How are all these variants/clades related to each other? CoVariants follows the Nextstrain Clade schema, where variants can descend from other variants. Here's a chart to show the overall relationships of Nextstrain Clades:
