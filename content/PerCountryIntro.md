# Overview of Clusters in Countries with >20 Sequences in any Cluster

Graphs show for each country, the proportion of total number of sequences, over time, that fall into defined variant groups. Countries are pre-selected to be displayed if they have at least 20 sequences in any variant being tracked (see [colors_and_countries.py](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/blob/master/scripts/colors_and_countries.pyy)).

Note that sequences with the 69 deletion or mutation at S:E484 in Spike are not shown on these plots as they commonly are found in other varaints (S:N439K, S:Y453F, and S:N501 for 69 deletion; S:N501 for S:E484), so they would be 'double-plotted'.

It is worth interpreting with caution:
- The last data point - this often has incomplete data and may change as more sequences come in
- Frequencies that are very 'jagged' - this often indicates low sequencing numbers and so may not be truly representative of the country
