The grey colour between the top of the coloured curve and '1' on the Y-axis is composed of variants that aren't currently tracked on CoVariants.
Sequence counts are binned into 2-week intervals.

<!-- **In early 2021** many places have started preferentially sequencing samples to detect the main variants of concern (see <Var name="20I/501Y.V1" prefix=""/>, <Var name="20H/501Y.V2" prefix=""/>, <Var name="20J/501Y.V3" prefix=""/>). Often this is through sequencing samples that have an 'S-drop-out,' which in particular biases the frequencies of <Var name="20A/S:439K"/> and 501Y.V1 (shown here as a bias in the 3 variants of concern). Alternatively, this can be through preferentially sequencing cases with particular travel histories, or connections to known cases of the variants of concern. -->

It is worth interpreting with caution:
- Not all samples are representative - sometimes some samples are more likely to be sequenced than others (for containing a particular mutation, for example)
- The last data point - this often has incomplete data and may change as more sequences come in
- Frequencies that are very 'jagged' - this often indicates low sequencing numbers and so may not be truly representative of the country
- In many places, sampling may not be equal across the region: samples may only cover one area or certain areas. It's important not to assume frequencies shown are necessarily representative.
