In the graphs below, the proportion of **sequences** (_not cases_) from each country that are designated as being in that variant or having that mutation, are plotted.

Countries are displayed in the chart if the country has at least 1200 sequences present in any variant or mutation.

Note the frequencies are displays in 2-week intervals without smoothing. Values with an asterisk and plotted in tiny dots denote linearly interpolated values where no data is available, to connect the line between real data values.
