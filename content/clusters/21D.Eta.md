Also known as `B.1.525`

<Var name="21D (Eta)"/> appears to have arisen in late 2020, and as of March 2020 has been detected in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.

This variant carries some mutations that are also seen in the variants of concern. <AaMut mut={"S:E484K"}/> (see <Mut name="S:E484"/>), is shared with <Var name="20H (Beta, V2)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)" prefix=""/>. <Mut name="S:H69-"/>, <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"}/>, and <Mut name="S:Y144-"/> are shared with <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/>.

Further, this variant has the same 3 amino acid deletion in `ORF1a` at positions 3675-5677 that is seen in all three variants of concern, as well as <Var name="21F (Iota)"/>.

In addition, mutation <AaMut mut={"S:Q677H"}/> has appeared multiple times (see <Var name="S:Q677"/>). There are also further mutations in Spike: <AaMut mut={"S:Q52R"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:A67V"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"Q:F888L"}/>.
