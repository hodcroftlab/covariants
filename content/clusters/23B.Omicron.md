### 23B (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="XBB.1.16" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="23B (Omicron)"/> likely arose at the end of 2022 or start of 2023, possibly in Asia. The first sequences date to January 2023 and the variant has spread significantly since then.
<br/><br/>

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.

<Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is a recombinant variant as it descends from <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, which is a recombination of lineage <Lin name="BJ.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.10.1.1"/>) (part of <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>) and <Lin name="BM.1.1.1"/> (<Lin name="BA.2.75.3.1.1.1"/>) (part of <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>). 
<br/>
<br/>

Thus, <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same mutations as <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, with a few additional mutations, including <AaMut mut={"S:G252V"}/> and <AaMut mut={"ORF8:G8*"}/> (both also seen independently in <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>), as well as <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3829F"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:D1746Y"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF9b:I5T"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"ORF9b:N55S"}/>.
<br/>

Also like <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> but arising independently, <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has an additional nucleotide mutation at position <NucMut mut="T23018C" />, which results in the <AaMut mut={"S:F486S"}/> in <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> becoming <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/>. This change from <code>S</code> to <code>P</code> has implications for ACE2 binding (see the <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> page). Additionally, <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has a unique synonymous mutations at <NucMut mut="T12730A" />, <NucMut mut="A14856G" />, and <NucMut mut="C29386T" />.
<br/>
<br/>

From the Spike mutations in <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, there is an expectation that immune evasion is likely similar to its parental lineages, <Lin name="XBB.1"/> and <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (<Lin name="XBB"/>), but again, as in <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, transmission may be enhanced by the <AaMut mut={"S:F486P"}/> mutation, and possibly further enhanced by RBD mutation <AaMut mut={"S:T478R"}/>. The impact of the Spike mutation <AaMut mut={"S:E180V"}/> is less clear.

- Neutralizing titers against sera from mRNA-vaccinated individuals with breakthrough BA.2/BA.5 infection suggest <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> evades immunity, possibly similarly to <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. As with <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (and other <Var name="22F (Omicron)" prefix=""/> sublineages), it is resistant to all monoclonal antibodies except strovimab. [Yamasoba et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535883v3)
- Binding affinity of <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> to the ACE2 receptor may be lower than <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> but higher than <Lin name="XBB.1" />. <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> was also estimated to have a higher reproductive number than <Var name="23A (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Lin name="XBB.1" />. [Yamasoba et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.535883v3)
- Early reports from India have suggested changing demographic and clinical associations with <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> infection, including reports of conjunctivitis. [Vashishtha et al., medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.18.23288715v1)
- The WHO designated <Var name="23B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> as a Variant of Interest (VOI) on 17 April 2023. The Initial Risk Assessment is avilable [here](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/21042023xbb.1.16ra-v2.pdf?sfvrsn=84577350_1) (updated risk assessments may be available from the main WHO website).
