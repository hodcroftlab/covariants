### 22E (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BQ.1" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="22E (Omicron)"/> likely arose in mid-2022, possibly in central or western Africa. It was first identified as 'of interest' in August and has expanded globally since then.
<br/><br/>

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.
<br/>

<Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> shares all the mutations (including in Spike) found in <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> (see this variant for more information on these mutations), but also has additional mutations.
<br/>

Outside of Spike, <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has futher mutations at 
<AaMut mut={"ORF1a:Q556K"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:L3829F"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:Y264H"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:M1156I"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF9b:P10F"}/> (compared to <AaMut mut={"ORF9b:P10s"}/> in <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>), and <AaMut mut={"N:E136D"}/>. 
<br />

Within Spike, <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has futher mutations at <AaMut mut={"S:K444T"}/> and <AaMut mut={"S:N460K"}/>.

From the mutations and initial lab results, there is concern that <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may have an increased ability to evade existing immunity.
- A study looking at ability to neutralize <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in vaccinated and vaccinated individuals with <Who name="Omicron" /> breakthrough infections, found significant reduction in neutralization titers while maintaining ACE2 binding abffinity ([Cao et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v3))
- The same study also found that <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> can escape the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) Evusheld and Bebtelovimab, making clinically available mAbs as of October 2022 likely ineffective against the variant ([Cao et al. bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.15.507787v3))
- A study looking at neutralizing antibody and memory B cell responses over time and after breakthrough infection found that <AaMut mut={"S:N460K"}/> escaped neutralizing antibodies and corresponded with the (then) newly emerging variant <Var name="22E (Omicron)" prefix=""/> ([Kaku et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.21.508922v1.full))
