### 20I (Alpha, V1)
Also known as <Lin name="B.1.1.7" /> and <Who name="Alpha" />

_Note that as of 15 Aug 2022, the Nextstrain build is no longer being regularly updated, as there is little ongoing circulation. It will continue to be tracked in the graphs._

Announced on the 14 Dec 2020, this variant appears to have arisen and/or initially expanded in the South East of England.

<Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)"/> is associated with multiple mutations in Spike. Most notably: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> (see <Mut name="S:N501"/>), and a deletion at 69/70 (see <Mut name="S:H69-"/>)). <br/>
But also <Mut name="S:Y144-"/> (deletion) and <AaMut mut={'S:P681H'}/> (adjacent to the furin cleavage site).

There is also a notable truncation of <code>ORF8</code>, with <AaMut mut={'ORF8:Q27*'}/> (becomes a stop codon) (deletion of <code>ORF8</code> was previously associated with reduced clinical severity (<LinkExternal href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)31757-8/fulltext">Young et al., Lancet</LinkExternal>)), and mutations in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:D3L'}/> and <AaMut mut={'N:S235F'}/>, as well as a deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) 3675-3677 (also seen in <Var name="20H (Beta, V2)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)" prefix=""/>, as well as some other variants of interest) (see <Mut name="ORF1a:S3675"/>).

The 69/70 deletion in this variant causes the S-assay within TaqPath tests to give a negative result, which can provide a useful proxy for prevalence of this variant (a phenomenon referred to as S-gene target failure or SGTF). However, as the 69/70 deletion is found in other variants/clusters (notably <Var name="20A/S:439K"/> and <Mut name="S:Y453F"/>), sequencing is needed to confirm identity, particularly in countries where <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/> is not dominant.
