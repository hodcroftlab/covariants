### 21A (Delta)
Also known as <Lin name="B.1.617.2" /> and <Who name="Delta" />

<Var name={'21A (Delta)'}/> is considered a "Variant of Concern" by the WHO. It was first detected in India and expanded rapidly, dominating in almost every country by late 2021. 
<br /><br />

<Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> has Spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:L452R'}/> (see <Var name={'21C (Epsilon)'}/> page for more details) and <Mut name="S:P681"/>, both of which impact antibody binding. 
<Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> has additional spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:T19R'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:R158G'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:T478K'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:D950N'}/>. Additionally, it has a deletion at positions <AaMut mut={'S:E156-'}/> and <AaMut mut={'S:F157-'}/>.

Sequences in <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> also have a deletion at positions <AaMut mut={'ORF8:D119-'}/> and <AaMut mut={'ORF8:F120-'}/>.

A single nucleotide deletion at <NucMut mut="A28271-" /> falls between the genes `S` and `N` and thus does not affect amino-acid coding.

- [The PHE technical briefings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-novel-sars-cov-2-variant-variant-of-concern-20201201) contain assessments of <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/>'s transmissibility 
- A study found that titers against `B.1.617` were reduced roughly 2-fold compared to <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/> and wild-type ([Yadav et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.441101v1))

Some <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> viruses have acquired an additional mutation at position <Mut name="S:K417"/> to N (click the mutation badge for more information on this mutation).

A Nextstrain build focused on <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> sequences with the <AaMut mut={'S:K417N'}/> mutation (including the two lineages above) can be seen [here](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/21A.Delta.S.K417?c=gt-S_417&f_clade_membership=21A%20%28Delta%29&label=clade:21A%20%28Delta%29) _(This build is no longer updated as of 3 May 2022)_.
