### 22D (Omicron)
Also known as <Lin name="BA.2.75" /> and <Who name="Omicron" />

<OmicronHead/>

<Var name="22D (Omicron)"/> appears to have arisen in late spring 2022, possibly in India. As of July 2022, the majority of sequences of this lineage have been detected in India, but many have also been detected around the world.
<br/><br/>

As with all <Who name="Omicron" /> variants, <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> is primarily of concern due to the the notable increase in transmission and immune evasion of this variant family. They have a large number of mutations in the Spike gene, with many of these in the receptor binding domain and N-terminal domain, which may play key roles in ACE2 binding and antibody recognition.
<br/>

<Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> shares many Spike mutations with <Var name="21K (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and even more Spike mutations with <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has the same Spike mutations as its parent, <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, except for <AaMut mut={"S:G446S"}/> (a reversion to <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>'s parent, 21M) and <AaMut mut={"S:R493Q"}/> (a reversion to wild-type), and the additional mutations: <AaMut mut={"S:W152R"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:F157L"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:I210V"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:G257S"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:G339H"}/> and <AaMut mut={"S:N460K"}/>.

An additional Spike mutation, <AaMut mut={"S:K147E"}/>, is found in many <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> sequences. However, this aren't found at the base of <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, and so isn't counted as a 'defining mutations' on CoVariants.

<Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> does not have the <Mut name="S:H69-"/> and <AaMut mut={"S:V70-"}/> deletion found in <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22C (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, and so could in theory be detected through "S gene drop out" in a <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> background. However, care should be taken to ensure such sequences are indeed <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and not another variant with the same deletion.

- As also found in <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, adintrevimab, bamlanivimab, casirivimab, etesevimab and imdevimab were not found to be effective against <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. Ragdanvimab, sotrovimab, and tixagevimab, while not functional against <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>, were found to be effective against <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. However, <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> exhibited higher resistance against cilgavimab and bebtelovimab than <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. ([Yamasoba et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.14.500041v1.full))
- <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> was found to be more immune-evasive than <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/> in areas with previously high levels of Delta infection (which may explain its success in India), and may escape <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>-induced immunity due to the <AaMut mut={"S:N460K"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:G446S"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:G339H"}/> and <AaMut mut={"S:R493Q"}/> mutations. <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> may also have higher ACE-2 binding affinity than <Var name="22A (Omicron)" prefix=""/>/<Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.18.500332v1">Cao et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
- A study with donated blood from Sweden failed to find greater immune evasion by <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> than <Var name="22B (Omicron)" prefix=""/>. <Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> was found to have moderate suceptibility to tixagevimab and cilgavimab.

<Var name="22D (Omicron)" prefix=""/> has additional amino-acid mutations outside of Spike, compared to <Var name="21L (Omicron)" prefix=""/>: <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:S1221L"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:P1640S"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1a:N4060S"}/>, <AaMut mut={"ORF1b:G662S"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"E:T11A"}/>.
