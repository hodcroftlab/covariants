### 20H (Beta, V2)
Also known as <Lin name="B.1.351" /> and <Who name="Beta" />

Announced in December 2020, 20H (Beta, V2) originated and/or initially expanded in South Africa ([Tegally et al., Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03402-9)).

<Var name="20H (Beta, V2)"/> is associated with multiple mutations in Spike. Most notably: <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> (see <Mut name="S:N501"/>) and <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> (see <Mut name="S:E484"/>). <br/>
But also <AaMut mut={'S:L18F'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:K417N'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:D80A'}/>.
Additionally, there is a deletion at Spike positions 241-243. This is sometimes reported as a mutation at positions 242-244. However, the location of the deletion is ambiguous and the resulting amino-acid sequence is identical either way (<LinkExternal href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03402-9">Tegally et al., Nature</LinkExternal>).
<br/><br/>
There is also a mutation in Nucleocapsid: <AaMut mut={'N:T205I'}/> and a deletion in <code>ORF1a</code>(<code>Nsp6</code>) at positions 3675-3677 (also seen in <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/> and <Var name="20J (Gamma, V3)" prefix=""/>, as well as some other variants of interest) (see <Mut name="ORF1a:S3675"/>).
It does *not* have the deletion at 69/70.

- Sera from individuals vaccined with the Moderna vaccine showed no significant reduction of neutralization against <Var name="20I (Alpha, V1)" prefix=""/> and a 6-fold reduction in <Var name="20H (Beta, V2)" prefix=""/>, but titers remained above levels expected to be protective ([Moderna website](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against))
- 20H (Beta, V2) is reported to have resistance to monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, with one study finding 93% of 44 plasma samples showed a reduction in titer and 48% had no detectable neutralization activity ([Wibmer et al., Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01285-x)). A further study also detected reduction in neutralization by convalescent plasma ([Cele et al., Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03471-w)).
- 20H (Beta, V2) has larger reduction to both mAbs and convalescent sera than 20I (Alpha, V1) ([Wang et al., Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2))
- The <AaMut mut={'S:N501Y'}/> mutation may help recover the decreased ACE2 binding observed with the <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/> mutation, though this may also be overcome by other mutations (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.07.21253098v2.full-text">Amanat et al., medRxiv</LinkExternal>)
